# Dictionaries versus Lists 

- Dictionaries are similar to lists, but there are a few differences:

- Both dictionaries and lists:
 are used to organize elements into collections;

- are used to initialize a new dictionary or list, use empty brackets;

- can iterate through the items or elements in the collection; and

- can use a variety of methods and operations to create and change the collections, like removing and inserting items or elements.

## Dictionaries only:
are unordered sets;

- have keys that can be a variety of data types, including strings, integers, floats, tuples;.

- can access dictionary values by keys;

- use square brackets inside curly brackets { [ ] };

- use colons between the key and the value(s);

- use commas to separate each key group and each value within a key group;
  make it quicker and easier for a Python interpreter to find specific elements, as compared to a list.

  ## Lists only:
 are ordered sets;

- access list elements by index positions;

- require that these indices be integers;

- use square brackets [ ];

- use commas to separate each list element.
