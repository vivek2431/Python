# Study Guide: Introduction to Python

This study guide provides a quick-reference summary of what you learned in this lesson and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz.

## Introduction to Python

Python is a general-purpose programming language commonly used for scripting and automation, as well as to develop a wide variety of applications. It is compatible with most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS, and is updated every few years. Python can run on servers, workstations, PCs, mobile devices, IoT, and more.

In the IT field, Python finds wide usage in IT support, system administration, web development, machine learning, data analytics, and more. Python can perform tasks such as calculating statistics, running e-commerce sites, processing images, interacting with web services, and more. Its syntax resembles the English language, making it easier to learn and understand compared to other programming languages.

### Python Features

- General-purpose scripting language
- Popular language for coding a variety of applications
- Frequently used for automation
- Cross-platform compatible
- Beginner-friendly

### Python is NOT:

- A platform-specific / OS-specific scripting language
- A client-side scripting language
- A purely object-oriented programming language

**Print to screen in Python:**
```python
print("Hello, how are you?")
Hello, how are you?
```


### Key Terms
- Platform-specific / OS specific scripting language***: Used by system administrators on specific platforms, e.g., PowerShell for Windows and Bash for Linux.

- Client-side scripting language: Used mostly for web programming. Scripts are transferred from a web server to the end-userâ€™s browser and executed there, e.g., JavaScript.

- Machine language: The lowest-level computer language, communicating directly with computing machines in binary code (ones and zeros).

- Cross-platform language: Compatible with one or more platforms/operating systems, e.g., Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android.

- Object-oriented programming language: Coding elements are considered objects with configurable properties.

- Python interpreter: Reads and executes Python code by translating it into computer instructions.
