## Python Terminology

### Built-in Functions
Functions that are part of Python's standard library and can be called directly.

### Comments
Notes added to code for documentation purposes, aiding in code readability and clarity for both the programmer and others who may read the code.

### Data Types
Classes of data in Python, such as string, integer, float, boolean, etc. Each data type has its own properties and behaviors.

### Explicit Conversion
Manually converting one data type to another using a data type conversion function, explicitly specifying the desired conversion.

### Expression
A combination of numbers, symbols, or other values that results in a single value when evaluated.

### Implicit Conversion
Automatic conversion of one data type to another by the Python interpreter, without the need for explicit instructions.

### Logical Operators
Operators used to combine or manipulate boolean values (True or False) to create complex conditions for decision-making.

### Parameter (Argument)
A value passed into a function for use within the function, influencing the function's behavior or output.

### Refactoring
The process of restructuring existing code to improve readability, maintainability, or performance without changing its external behavior.

### Return Value
The value or variable returned as the outcome of a function's execution, providing the result of the function's operation.

### Break
A way to exit out of a loop before the loop's condition is false.

### Control Statements
Programming constructs that direct the flow of execution of a program by allowing you to make decisions, repeat actions, or choose between different code paths based on specific conditions.

### For Loop
This executes a block of code for a specified number of iterations or over a collection of items.

### Infinite Loop
A sequence that is missing a method for exiting the loop, causing the loop to run forever.

### Iterators
Variables that allow you to loop through a collection one item at a time.

### Loop
A sequence that makes the computer do repetitive tasks.

### Programming
The process of writing a program to behave in different ways.

### Pass
A placeholder statement which is used when the syntax requires a statement, but you don't want to execute any code or command.

### Recursion
The repeated application of the same procedure to a smaller problem.

### While Loop
This is used when a segment of code needs to execute repeatedly while a condition is true.
