# Programming Concepts

## Automation
Automation is the process of replacing a manual step with one that happens automatically.

## Client-side Scripting Language
Primarily for web programming; the scripts are transferred from a web server to the end-userâ€™s internet browser, then executed in the browser.

## Code Editors
Tools to provide features, including syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, error checking, and autocompletion.

## Computer Program
A step-by-step list of instructions that a computer follows to reach an intended goal.

## Functions
A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
A software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development.

## Interpreter
The program that reads and executes code.

## Input
Information that is provided to a program by the end user.

## Logic Errors
Errors in code that prevent it from running correctly.

## Machine Language
Lowest-level computer language. It communicates directly with computing machines in binary code (ones and zeros).

## Object-Oriented Programming Language
Most coding elements are considered to be objects with configurable properties.

## Output
The end result of a task performed by a function or computer program.

## Platform-Specific Scripting Language
Language used by system administrators on those specific platforms.

## Programming
The process of writing a program to behave in different ways.

## Programming Code
A set of written computer instructions, guided by rules, using a computer programming language.

## Programming Languages
Language with syntax and semantics to write computer programs.

## Python
A general-purpose programming language.

## Python Interpreter
A program that reads and executes Python code by translating Python code into computer instructions.

## Script
Often used to automate specific tasks.

## Semantics
The intended meaning or effect of statements, or collections of words, in both human and computer languages.

## Syntax
The rules for how each statement is constructed in both human and computer languages.

## Variables
These are used to temporarily store changeable values in programming code.

# Terms

## Expression
A combination of numbers, symbols, or other values that produce a result when evaluated.

## Data Types
Classes of data (e.g., string, int, float, Boolean, etc.), which include the properties and behaviors of instances of the data type (variables).

## Variable
An instance of a data type class, represented by a unique name within the code, that stores changeable values of the specific data type.

## Implicit Conversion
When the Python interpreter automatically converts one data type to another.

## Explicit Conversion
When code is written to manually convert one data type to another using a data type conversion function:

- `str()`: Converts a value (often numeric) to a string data type.
- `int()`: Converts a value (usually a float) to an integer data type.
- `float()`: Converts a value (usually an integer) to a float data type.
