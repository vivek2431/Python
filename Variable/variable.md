## Variables


In Python, a variable is a name that refers to a value stored in the computer's memory. Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program. Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require explicit declaration of variables before they are used. When you assign a value to a variable, Python automatically creates the variable and allocates memory for it.

You can assign various types of data to variables in Python, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more. The type of data that a variable can hold is determined dynamically based on the value assigned to it.

Python variable names must follow certain rules:

- Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).

- Variable names cannot start with a digit.
- Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., myVar, MyVar, and myvar are three different variables).
- Python keywords cannot be used as variable names.
