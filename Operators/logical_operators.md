# Logical Operators in Python

Logical operators in Python are used to perform logical operations on boolean values or expressions. Python supports three main logical operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`. Here's an overview of each:

1. **Logical AND (`and`):**
   - The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     x = True
     y = False
     print(x and y)  # Output: False
     ```

2. **Logical OR (`or`):**
   - The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     x = True
     y = False
     print(x or y)  # Output: True
     ```

3. **Logical NOT (`not`):**
   - The `not` operator negates the boolean value of its operand. If the operand is `True`, it returns `False`, and if the operand is `False`, it returns `True`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     x = True
     print(not x)  # Output: False
     ```

These logical operators are often used in conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and boolean expressions to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions. Understanding how to use logical operators is essential for writing efficient and expressive Python code.
