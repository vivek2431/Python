# Assignment Operator

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. In Python, the most common assignment operator is the equals sign `=`. Here's a simple example:

```python
x = 5  # Assigns the value 5 to the variable x
This line of code assigns the value 5 to the variable x.

Python also provides compound assignment operators, which combine an arithmetic operation with assignment. For example:

python
x += 2  # Equivalent to: x = x + 2
This line of code increments the value of x by 2.

Here are some commonly used compound assignment operators:

+= : Add and Assign
-= : Subtract and Assign
*= : Multiply and Assign
/= : Divide and Assign
%= : Modulus and Assign
**= : Exponentiate and Assign
//= : Floor Divide and Assign
You can use these compound assignment operators to perform an operation and assign the result back to the variable in a single step. For example:

python
x = 10
x += 3  # Equivalent to: x = x + 3
print(x)  # Output: 13
This code increments the value of x by 3 and assigns the result back to x, so x becomes 13.
